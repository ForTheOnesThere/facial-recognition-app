This is a simple react app that uses a facial recongnition API to detect faces in pictures. It also has some simple sign in/out features.
The app uses node.js and express.js on the backend, and React on the front end. The backend and database are deployed on Heroku, and the interface between PostgreSQL and express is implemented with knex.js.
